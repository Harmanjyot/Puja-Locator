It is a sacred mixture of five ingredients i.e. milk, curd, honey, jaggery and ghee. Though jaggery is needed, nowadays sugar is being used instead. The five Devas (deities) reside in these five ingredients. Savitru resides in sugar, Vishwedeva in honey, Surya in ghee, Vayu in curd and Soma in milk. So when you offer them as Abhisheka, the intention is that may the divine qualities of these Devas blossom in our lives. ";
